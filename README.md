# Encryptor

This program allows you to store messages in encrypted .SV files that are organized with a XML parsed dictionary data struct.
You can also send base64 text of your encrypted message to a freind easily. This is all with the security of RSA 4096.

In order to unzip the folder that contains the EXE & data to execute you have to use 7zip

The code is also contained here so i guess you could compile your own version if you where smart enough,
but its probably just easier to extract the file with 7Zip.
